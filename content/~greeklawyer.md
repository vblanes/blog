## Posible solution

Some researchers have speculated about the possibility of overcoming the different agenda problems by meeting on Sunday for brunch! One of the possibilities is to go to [La FÃ¡brica de Hielo](https://www.lafabricadehielo.net/evento/musica-en-viu/djs-convidats/diumenges-turia-21/) to hear some live music and maybe drink some vermouth. If you are an awesome greek lawyer and agree with this great plan (or have a better suggestion), please scan the following QR code.
